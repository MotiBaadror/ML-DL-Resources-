# Welcome to computer vision source repo

In this repository I would be sharing resources important for computer vision

- [Pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/start-here/)
This link will cover the basic opencv, then cnn, transfer learning and custom modeling, and deep learning dataset preparation and model training. Code is also available in the articles.
